# Recruiting made easy. 
Fall is an incredibly busy time for recruiters, as students begin looking for summer internship and full-time placements alike. At career fairs and recruiting events, recruiters have hundreds of conversations, business cards, and paper resumes, scattered and separate. The sheer volume of applicants means that recruiters can't remember faces to names, and names to resumes, making the aftermath of a recruiting event a sticky situation.

# Resudrop as a solution
This weekend at Hack Western, we built Resudrop, a website and android application that solves this inconvenience. Resudrop enables applicants to upload their resume online and then access a corresponding QR code on their mobile devices to shows recruiters. Recruiters can then scan the code and access the document on their own devices, adding their ratings and thoughts, and maintain an organized repository of all the collected resumes.
